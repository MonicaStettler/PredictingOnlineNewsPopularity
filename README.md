# PredictingOnlineNewsPopularity
Group project for course Advanced Data Analysis (CSC424) using R


ABSTRACT

Online news has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is the preferred channel for
many to receive their news content. The goal of our research was to build a model that would
predict the number of shares of online news article using several exploratory and predictive
modeling techniques. The methods utilized for this research include decision trees, random
forest, principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (CFA), canonical correlation analysis
(CCA), correspondence analysis (CA), and linear regression. Our research revealed that strong
negative and positive words are the biggest influencers in whether an online news item get
shared a lot.

The code in this repository was soley my own work. In the presentation, I created slides 1-12 and 35-40. I wrote most of the Executive Summary.
In the Technical Review, I wrote pages 1-6 (Intro, Abstract, Literature review, Methods (chart on p.3 created by Akbar Aidarov), and PCA), pages 17-19 (linear regression using PCA componants) and contributed to the Discussion, Results and Conclusion sections.
